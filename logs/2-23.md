#remove wrong picture of 8 clusters and modify the networkx part so that the correct connected component with length larger then 8 are produced.

By checking the 8_cluster file, 1_19 was found in motif group4. And in the old version clustering, 1_19 was included both in motif group4 and group7.

After discussion with Taylor, we decided to look into connected component that with length 7 or 8 and try to find where those missing motifs are.
